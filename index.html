          <h2>MS Dhoni</h2>
          <p>MS Dhoni is the only international captain to win all three ICC global trophies – the World T20 in 2007, the Cricket World Cup (50-over) in 2011 and the Champions Trophy in 2013. His record as all-time skipper of the Chennai Super Kings in the IPL is equally stunning – three crowns, four runners-up finishes, Playoffs in all nine seasons apart from the Champions League T20 trophies in 2010 and 2014.</p>

          <h2>Ambati Rayudu</h2>
          <p>Ambati Rayudu is a stylish middle-order batsman who has built a reputation of being a dangerous floater owing to his clean striking of the ball and cool approach. The 33-year-old was a revelation for CSK at the top of the order during the victorious 2018 campaign which led to his One-Day International comeback.</p>

          <p>Shane Watson remains a top performer in the T20 circuit across the globe even after the 37-year-old Australian retired from international cricket post the 2016 World T20. The Queensland-born is a clean striker of the ball and this makes him a serious threat anywhere in the batting order. Add to it his reliable and accurate fast-medium bowling, lending that vital balance to any line-up.</p>

          <p>Faf du Plessis’ biggest strength as a batsman is his ability to play according to situation. The tall, classy South African can, in fact, bat at any slot, is a fine crafter of an innings and a powerful striker of the ball. Strong on the front foot and possessing a sound defence, he is also a livewire on the field.</p>

          <p>Dwayne Bravo has won the Purple Cap for most wickets on two occasions (2013 & 2015). However, numbers alone do not give the full picture of the Caribbean all-rounder’s contribution, given the high-impact nature of his play – big blows with the willow when it matters and a death overs specialist. Bravo relishes a challenge and comes out on top more often than not.</p>

          <h2>Kedhar Jadhav</h2>
          <p>An aggressive middle-order batsman blessed with great hand-eye coordination, Kedar Jadhav is widely acknowledged as a natural T20 player. The spunky Maharashtra cricketer has developed into a part-time off-spinner in ODIs, although the 34-year-old is yet to appear in the bowling column in the IPL. His low, slingy action makes him deceptive given the angle of his release but with the bat in hand Jadhav is a commanding presence.</p>

In the 2011 season, Vijay struck a 52-ball 95 in the final against Royal Challengers Bangalore to set up a winning total of 205-5 at Chepauk when the Lions became the first team to retain the title and the first to win it at home.</p>

          <h2>Karn Sharma</h2>
          <p>Wrist spinners are making a huge impact in the shorter formats of the game and Karn Sharma, who represented India in Test, ODIs and T20I in 2014, is one such bowler. A gutsy spinner and a useful batsman, Karn has not only added more variations to his repertoire but has also worked on imparting more revolutions to his stock delivery.</p>
